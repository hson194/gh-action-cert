# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
    # inputs:
    #   name:
    #     description: "Your name"
    #     required: true
    #     default: "World"

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Testing secret value from Github secrets
